However, to truly understand how coding works and to become a confident programmer, it's important to go beyond simply using these functions and explore how they work under the hood. By learning to recreate these functions manually, students can deepen their understanding of fundamental concepts such as loops, conditionals, and data structures. The following is a curated list of essential problems designed to build that foundational knowledge. In most cases, we will also mention the corresponding built-in Python functions to highlight their functionality and provide context. While not exhaustive, these exercises provide a solid foundation for mastering the fundamentals of one-dimensional arrays in Python.**\n","\n","1. Sum of Elements\n","Write a function that takes a list and returns the sum of its elements.\n","\n","1. Find the Maximum and Minimum\n","Return the largest and smallest element in the list.\n","\n","1. Count Occurrences\n","Count how many times a given number appears in the list.\n","\n","1. Reverse the Array\n","Write a function to reverse the list without using built-in `reverse()`.\n","\n","1.

Linear Search\n","Check if a given number is present in the list.\n","\n","1. Rotate Array\n","Rotate elements of the list to the right by k positions.\n","\n","1. Check for Palindrome\n","Check if the array reads the same forward and backward.\n","\n","1. Remove Duplicates\n","Write a function to return a new list without repeated values.\n","\n","1. Bubble Sort\n","Repeatedly step through the list, compare adjacent elements, and swap them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.\n","\n","1. Elementwise Operations\n","Square every element of the array using vectorized operations.\n","\n","1. Boolean Masking\n","Extract all elements greater than a certain threshold.\n","\n","1.
